# JobsWebscraper

##### JobsWebscraper is idea of application helping me in my upskilling process. 
The first goal of this solution is to produce technologies popularity report. This is done based on two conditions (source, technologies filter).

1. source - job portal used for technologies data scrapping
2. technologies_filter - list of technologies (or competencies/categories) used for searching job ads

Development state (28/01/2021):
 - generating tech_popularity_report from first source (f-scrapper) is ready.
