# JobsWebscraper

##### JobsWebscraper is idea of application helping me in my upskilling process. 
The first goal of this solution is to produce technologies popularity report. This is done based on two conditions (source, technologies filter).

1. source - job portal used for technologies data scrapping
2. technogies_filter - list of technologies (or competencies/categories) used for searching job ads

## 
### Development state:

11/12/2020)
 - generating tech_popularity_report from first source (f-scrapper) is ready (but bugs exist).



##### Possible ways of improvement:
a) to improve quality of tech_popularity_report data (from first source)

b) to implement generalization of context for scrapping in f-scrapper (there are only specific methods now)

c) to add next source job_portal (j) and implement j-scrapper

d) collect data daily (jenkins or other CI tool)

e) develop trends generation based on historical data
